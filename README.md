# Made with ❤ by yours truly 

# Acknowledgement
I would like to start by thanking my teacher Ms.Divya John for giving me the best introduction to the Java world.

# Introduction
This repo consists of my work on Java and the simple programs which i had done inorder to learn Java.  

To be specific my aim was to familiarize with the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University's (initially Kerala Technological University(KTU)) [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ojglPaasIEUUFuSVRXbDlZTEk/view) for Java.  

Created this repository with the aim of helping out my friends and others to understand the basics of Java and to understand its scope by doing some programs. 

# Requirements
1) Java (Obviously) --> [Install Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml)
2) Java SE Development Kit(JDK) --> [Install JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html)
3) For coding make use of IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html#section=linux)  
   or Text Editors like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  
   or the classic and powerful command line editor [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) which i use. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

# How to use my repositiory? 
Assuming that you've already installed the above requirements and it is in a working condition. Then:-    
1) Fork the repository(optional)
2) Clone/Download the files into your local machine  
   ###### For Linux Users :-  
   [Set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) in your local machine  
   From the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.  
   Then from command line create a clone in your local machine by:-  
   ```bash
   git clone url
   ```
   ###### For Other Users :-
   Follow this [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

# Content

1. [Method Overiding and Overloading](https://www.programcreek.com/2009/02/overriding-and-overloading-in-java-with-examples/) 
1. [Static Instances](https://www.javatpoint.com/static-keyword-in-java) 
1. [Threads](https://www.javaworld.com/article/2077138/java-concurrency/introduction-to-java-threads.html) 
1. [String](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_strings.htm) 
1. [Streams and IO](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html) 
1. [Exception Handling](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/) 
1. [AWT](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-awt) 
1. [Swing](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javaswingtutorial/) 
1. [File Handling](http://www.dailyfreecode.com/code/file-handling-java-3430.aspx) 
1. [Event Hadnling](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/index.html) 
1. [Data Structures](http://java.wikia.com/wiki/Data_Structures)
1. [Interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html)

## A bit about what each directory in my repo has to offer

```
1) EastKtuMath
	└──── Numerical Integration using Trapezoidal or Simpsons Methods
	└──── Get all the math steps as output (optional)
	└──── Streams for IO 
	└──── An exquisite expression parser included within
	└──── And yes you guessed it right! I used to do all my math assignements this way. :D

2) Threads
	└──── By Runnable Interface 
	└──── By Extending Thread Class
	└──── Runnable Interface in Main
	└──── Synchronization
	└──── Some fine practice problems

3) EventHandling
	└──── Creates a simple login Graphical User Interface(GUI)
	└──── Covers basics of java.awt and some of Swing
	└──── Learn basics of Listeners 
	└──── Basics from this required in upcoming programs

4) Overloading and Overriding
	└──── Learn the basics of Overloading,Overriding
	└──── Dynamic Method Dispatching 
	└──── What's super() and what is "this"? You will see
	└──── Basics of jump statements
	└──── Interfaces and Implementation
	└──── Basics of Packages
	└──── File Handling basics

5) S3CsSgpa      
	└──── Well? Want to apply what you've learnt? This is your opportunity. 
	└──── Creates a simple GUI to find your SGPA
	└──── Sorting 
	└──── Data Structures 
	└──── Provides a great idea on javax.swing(the 'x' matters :p) 
	└──── Love designing? Play with java.awt.Color
```      

# What's next?
Now what you waiting for? Compile all the `*.java` files and run it.  

If you're using an IDE like Intellij then i suggest you follow this [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2017.1/creating-running-and-packaging-your-first-java-application.html).  

For all others, the most easiest way would be to fire up your Terminal Emulator or Command Line(cmd) for Windows users and change directory (eg:- cd S3CsSgpa) into the one of the directories in my repo.  

Then compile into the same directory (which the "." represents) by:

```bash
javac -d . *.java
```

After creating the compiled .class file, just run it using (avoid the .class extension):

```bash
java classWhichConsistsOfMainMethod
```

What if it's part of a Package? No problemo. After compiling, run:

```bash
java nameOfPackage.filename
```

# Contact
Having issues in the program? Open up an issue in the issues counter, so that I could know about it.

Feel free to contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yedhin1998/) if you have any questions.

# Credits
Without [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) and [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) this project wouldn't have become a reality. Well thanks to Bram Moolenaar. [Oracle Java Documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html), [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) were also great references. Last but not the least , I would like to mention [Arch Linux](https://www.distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=arch) for providing me with such a smooth sailing workflow `->` "makepkg! Not war".
